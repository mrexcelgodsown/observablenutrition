# ObservableLab — Nutrition QA (Upgraded)

This is an upgraded multi-page static portfolio site themed around a Nutrition Label QA Automation project.
It includes:
- Multi-page static site: index, explore, notebooks, about, contact
- Particles.js animated background, floating orbs, and navy-gold aesthetic
- Chart.js interactive charts simulating anomaly detection (Isolation Forest style)
- Contact form integrated with FormSubmit.co (sends to mrexcelgodsown@gmail.com)
- Ready to deploy on Vercel or GitHub Pages

## How to deploy
1. Unzip the folder.
2. Push to GitHub or drag the folder into Vercel (New Project → Import).
3. If using FormSubmit, the first form submission will send a confirmation email to mrexcelgodsown@gmail.com — confirm to activate.

## Files
- index.html
- explore.html
- notebooks.html
- about.html
- contact.html
- assets/styles.css
- assets/shared.js

## Customize
Edit `index.html` and other pages to replace sample text, add real notebooks or embedded dashboards (iframe screenshots, Observable embeds, or links to Dash apps).

Enjoy — let me know if you want automated CI, CMS, or live notebook embedding next!
